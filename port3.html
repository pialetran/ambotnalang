                <h2>Number System</h2>
                <p> Number system is a way of representing numbers, also
 called a system of numeration, that defines a set of values to
 represent quantities. These numbers are used as digits, and
 the most common numbers are 0 and 1, which are used to
 represent binary numbers. However, the digits 0-9 are used
 to represent other number systems. </p>

                            digits: 0 and 1. This approach is very user-friendly
                            and is widely utilized in computer applications

                        <p> The octal number system uses numbers from 0 to 7 to

                            programs frequently use octal numbers. An example is
                            provided below to illustrate how converting an octal
                            number to decimal is the same as converting a decimal

                <h2>Significance</h2>
                <p>The number system is significant because it helps us
                    express amounts in an organized way that people and
                    computers can understand. According to
                    GeeksforGeeks (2021), it is important in computing
                    since machines follow patterns made from 0 and 1 to
                    read and handle data. This structure allows information
                    to be processed correctly and keeps tasks clear and
                    manageable. Because of this, number systems play a
                    major role in both daily activities and digital
                    technology.</p>

        <div class="discription1">
            <p>I learned in Cuemath (n.d.) that a number system is a
 way of representing numbers, also called a system of
 numeration, that defines a set of values to represent
 quantities. These numbers are used as digits, and the most
 common numbers are 0 and 1, which are used to represent
 binary numbers. However, the digits 0-9 are used to
 represent other number systems. In GeeksforGeeks (2021), I
 learned why number systems matter, especially in
 computing. It showed that computers depend on patterns
 using only two digits, 0 and 1. Just like in Cuemath, I
 mentioned there that 0 and 1 are the most common numbers
 that represent binary. However, it didn’t mention where we
 use these numbers, and in GeekandGeeks, it says the number
 systems are commonly used in everyday life on computers.
 According to BYJUS (n.d.), I gain an understanding that
 number systems provide a unique representation of every
 number and represent the arithmetic and algebraic structure
 of the figures. I learned that this allows us to perform
 arithmetic 
operations 
like 
addition, 
subtraction,
 multiplication, and division. Another lesson that I learned is
 that values of any digit in a number can be determined by the
 digit, position in the number, and the base of the number
 system.</p>

    <!--Box 2 (Middle box)-->
    <div class="Voxing2">
        <div class="discription2">
            <p> There are four types of Number Systems,
 which are the Binary, Decimal, Octal, and
 Hexadecimal number systems. Cuemath (n.d.)
 explained that the decimal system uses ten digits
 and is the one we use in normal counting. BYJU’S
 (n.d.) described the binary system as a form made
 of only 0 and 1, which confused me at first. But the
 Studocu (2023) explained why binary is needed
 since computers operate using on-and-off signals.
 I also learned that the octal and hexadecimal
 systems use different bases and are helpful for
 computer tasks where shorter forms of values are
 needed. Unacademy (n.d.) shared examples
 showing how these systems appear in real-life
 situations, which made the topic easier for me to
 understand.

    <div class="Voxing3">
        <div class="discription3">
            <p>As I read more, I realized the importance
 and uses of each system. Decimal is essential for
 counting, money, measurements, and all
 everyday tasks (Cuemath, n.d.). Binary is the
 “language” of machines because it matches how
 circuits behave (GeeksforGeeks, 2021). Octal was
 widely used in earlier computers, and it still
 helps in some programming situations (Phantom
 Kills, 2023). Hexadecimal is very important for
 memory locations, color codes, and digital
 design because it simplifies long binary values
 (BYJU’S, n.d.). Unacademy (n.d.) also highlighted
 how these systems help in organizing data,
 solving 
problems, 
and 
making digital
 information easier to handle.</p>

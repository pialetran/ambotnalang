                <p>The motherboard is one of the essential components of a computer, as it serves as the 
primary platform that connects key components, including the CPU, RAM, and 
expansion cards, which facilitates the communication and power distribution of these 
components. The motherboard is often described as the backbone of the computer, as it 
connects the essential components such as the CPU, RAM, and expansion cards. It 
facilitates communication between all connected components and distributes power to 
them. The motherboard comes in various types and sizes known as form factors, which 
dictate their physical dimensions, power supply type, and the placement of mounting 
holes and ports. </p>

                <h2>Discussion</h2>
                <p>Motherboards come in different forms. Let’s start with the early motherboards, which 
are the Advanced Technology (AT) motherboard and the Low Profile Extension (LPX) 
motherboard. These motherboards helped shape the future of computer hardware by 
creating the basic designs that later ones followed. IBM introduced AT in August 1984, 
and LPX was developed by Western Digital in 1987. Moving on to the modern standard 
motherboards, which are Advanced Technology Extended (ATX), Standard-ATX, 
Extended-ATX (E-ATX), and Mini-ATX motherboards, each one of these form factors 
has a distinct size and features. The modern standard motherboards are very important 
parts of a computer because they connect and control all the other parts, just like a 
body’s nervous system. Among all the modern standard motherboards, the ATX is the 
most common due to its versatility, having many features, and having been trusted in 
the PC industry for a long time. Proceeding to the compact and efficient motherboards, 
and under this are micro-ATX, mini-ITX, and pico-BTX motherboards. The compact 
and efficient motherboards are important for building small PCs, which are becoming 
popular because they look good and can perform as well as bigger computers. Lastly, the 
BTX motherboard—some say it's the alternative design motherboard. The BTX 
motherboard, which stands for Balanced Technology eXtended, is a type of 
motherboard and computer case made by Intel to solve heating and power problems 
found in the older ATX design. </p>

                <h2>Motherboard Form Factors</h2>
                <p>The motherboard serves as the primary platform that connects key computer components, 
                    facilitating communication and power distribution between them. Different form factors 
                    exist to accommodate various needs, from early designs like AT and LPX to modern standards 
                    like ATX and compact options like Mini-ITX. Each form factor has distinct dimensions, 
                    features, and applications in computer systems.</p>

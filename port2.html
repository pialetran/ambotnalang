                <h2>Data and Information</h2>
                <p>Data consists of raw, unprocessed facts and observations that 
                    lack meaning on their own. Information is created when data is 
                    organized, interpreted, and given context, making it useful for 
                    understanding and decision-making. The transformation from data 
                    to information involves processing and analysis to reveal patterns 
                    and insights. Ultimately, information empowers individuals and 
                    organizations to act with clarity and purpose.</p>

                <h2>Information System</h2>
                <p>An Information System (IS) is an integrated and interconnected 
                    set of essential components—including people, hardware, 
                    software, networks, and data—that work synergistically to collect, 
                    process, store, and distribute meaningful information within an 
                    organization. It functions as a critical bridge between advanced 
                    technology and core business operations, transforming raw data into 
                    actionable intelligence that supports day-to-day functions, enhances 
                    managerial decision-making, and aligns with long-term strategic objectives. 
                    By streamlining workflows, improving communication, and fostering innovation, 
                    an IS enables organizations to operate more efficiently, adapt to changing environments, 
                    and sustain a competitive advantage in an increasingly digital and data-driven world. 
                    Ultimately, it serves as the technological backbone that supports organizational growth, 
                    operational excellence, and informed leadership at every level.</p>

                            ESS supports strategic decision-making by focusing on long-term

            <p>Birnbaum (2007) described data as facts or observations that form the base of
 information. Since data alone has no meaning, it must be processed into something
 useful. Heryana et al. (2020) said information comes from processing data to explain
 real events and assist in making decisions. Zins (2007) There are many ways to define
 data, information, and knowledge, but no single definition of information is widely
 accepted. Mai (2013) mentioned that good information should be accurate and clear.
 Malita and Stefean (2018) explained that turning raw data into useful information
 takes effort, with big data handling unstructured data. Each research author has a
 different definition; for instance, Birnbaum states that data alone is not useful, and I do
 have to agree because if it’s just data alone without interpretation, what is the purpose
 of it? In regard to this question, it was slightly answered by Heryana et al. because she
 mentioned that information comes from data, hence information is made from data.
 Mia stated that information should be clear and accurate in order to understand it.
 Malita and Stefan said that interpreting data into information takes time and effort,
 even though Zins mentions that there is no single definition of information that is
 widely accepted, but with other authors' definitions, I do believe that there is a
 definition of information.</p>

            <p> Information systems (IS) have many definitions, showing
 the field’s complexity. Pustaka et al. (2018) see IS as
 people, hardware, software, networks, and data working
 together to process and share information, like a team
 e fort. Paul et al. (2020) focus on IS as electronic systems
 that deliver information. Alter (2008) noted that while
 some view IS as a real-world system, the lack of one
 definition causes cha lenges. Boe l & Cecez-Kecmanovic
 (2015) stressed di fering perspectives, while Westfa l
 (2012) highlighted IS as a bridge between computer
 science and business, valued worldwide</p>

    <!--Box 3 (Bottom box)-->
    <div class="Voxing3">
        <div class="discription3">
            <p>According to Clark et al. (2007), support systems in Information Systems (IS) meet organizational needs such as decision
                making, process management, and performance improvement. Types include Transaction Processing Systems (TPS), Management
                Information Systems (MIS), Decision Support Systems (DSS), Executive Support Systems (ESS/EIS), Knowledge Management
                Systems (KMS), and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). TPS handles routine business transactions, as Sofyan et al. (2022) stated,
                while Mishra (2013) stated that MIS organizes information for better decisions. DSS assists decision-making with computer-based
                tools, Amalia & Aras (2022) noted. ESS supports executives, as Clark et al. stated. Alavi & Leidner's (2001) definition of KMS is that
                it manages organizational knowledge. ERP integrates cross-functional information needs, Brown & Vessey (1999) stated. These
                support systems, each kind has a distinct but related function in organizations. DSS and ESS assist with higher-level decisions, whereas
                TPS and MIS concentrate on operations and management. KMS makes learning ongoing by assisting in the collection and
                dissemination of knowledge. ERP ensures seamless departmental coordination by bringing everything together. This diversity
                demonstrates that for organizations to achieve accuracy, efficiency, and long-term growth, multiple systems must cooperate.</p>

                <h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
                <p> Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a 
                    computer system, including the processor, memory, storage 
                    devices, and input/output peripherals as described by 
                    Stallings (2012). These tangible elements form the 
                    foundational infrastructure that enables computing 
                    operations to occur, with designs evolving over time to 
                    create systems that are faster, more reliable, and i
                    ncreasingly efficient according to Mano and Giletti (2017). 
                    Hardware represents the visible side of technology that 
                    continues to progress, becoming smaller in size, more affordable, 
                    and more powerful while serving as the solid base upon which all other technology functions. </p>

                <h2>Software</h2>
                <p>Software consists of programs and instructions that direct computer 
                    hardware to perform specific tasks and solve problems, as defined by 
                    Sommerville (2011). This intangible component of computing systems is 
                    categorized into three main types: system software that enables computers 
                    to function properly (like operating systems), application software that 
                    supports business and organizational needs, and development software 
                    used for creating other programs according to Brookshear and Brylow (2019). 
                    Software engineering practices ensure these programs are dependable and effective, 
                    demonstrating that software encompasses a broad range of types 
                    serving different purposes across all areas of computing beyond just simple applications.</p>

                <h2>Implementation of Hardware and Software</h2>
                <p>The implementation of hardware and software within community institutions 
                    demonstrates how technology serves practical societal needs across various 
                    sectors. Educational institutions utilize e-learning systems, projectors, 
                    and digital libraries to enhance teaching methodologies and learning 
                    experiences, while healthcare facilities rely on information systems and 
                    specialized medical software to improve patient record management and 
                    diagnostic accuracy. Government offices employ databases and administrative 
                    systems to streamline public services, and businesses leverage computing 
                    technologies to manage operations, marketing, and financial activities, 
                    collectively showing that technology plays a crucial role in organizational 
                    efficiency and community development beyond mere personal use.</p>

            <p>Learning about computer hardware, software, and
 their use in institutions gave me a better view of
 how technology works in society. Computer hardware
 refers to the physical parts of a computer like
 the processor, memory, storage, and devices for
 input and output as Stallings (2012) states. It is
 the visible side of technology that makes
 computing possible. Mano and Ciletti (2017) point
 out that hardware designs have advanced over time
 to create systems that are both faster and more
 dependable. Similarly, Brookshear and Brylow
 (2019) note that hardware keeps progressing,
 becoming smaller in size, more affordable, and
 increasingly powerful. Flynn and Hung (2005) also
 show that hardware performance is tied to how well
 it can support applications. Reading these made me
 realize that hardware is the solid base for all
 other technology. Hennessy and Patterson (2011)
 emphasize that understanding computer architecture
 is key to improving efficiency and performance in
 modern systems. Reading these made me realize that
 hardware is the solid base for all other
 technology.</p>

    <div class="Voxing2">
        <div class="discription2">
            <p>  Software, meanwhile, gives instructions to hardware so that tasks can be performed.
 Sommerville (2011) defines software as programs that control the hardware and solve
 problems. Brookshear and Brylow (2019) group software into system software,
 application software, and development software. Tanenbaum and Bos (2015) explain
 that system software, such as operating systems, is what makes computers function
 properly. Laudon and Laudon (2020) emphasize that application software plays a key
 role in supporting businesses and organizations. Pressman (2014) states that
 software engineering is important to make programs dependable. From these points, I
 realized that software goes beyond simple applications; it covers a broad range of
 types that serve different purposes across all areas of computing.

    <!--Box 3 (Bottom box)-->
    <div class="Voxing3">
        <div class="discription3">
            <p> I also understood how hardware and software affect institutions in the
 community. Schools use e-learning systems, projectors, and digital libraries
 to improve teaching, as Anderson & Dexter (2005) states. Hospitals rely on
 information systems and machines that work with medical software to improve
 patient records and diagnosis, as Hoyt & Yoshihashi (2014) states. Heeks
 (2006) says that government offices use databases and systems to make their
 services faster and easier. As Laudon and Laudon (2020), they mention that
 businesses use computers and software to manage their work, marketing, and
 finances. Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) mention that these technologies are
 changing how industries work and how jobs are done. From these examples, I
 learned that technology is not just for personal use but is very important in
 helping communities grow.
</p>
    <p>
         I also believe that hardware and
 software are equally important.
 Hardware alone cannot function
 without the right software, while
 software 
cannot 
me 
run 
without
 dependable hardware. What stood out
 to 
is 
technology 
that 
improves 
even 
though
 efficiency,
 there are still issues with unequal
 access. While some businesses still
 rely on old technology, others use
 or 
are 
equipped 
modern
 equipment. This shows that the use
 of technology requires not just
 proper 
Analysis 
with 
maintenance 
but 
fairness in accessibility.

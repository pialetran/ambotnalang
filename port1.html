                <h2>Computer Science</h2>
                <p>     Computer Science (CS) is a discipline that emphasizes the theoretical and scientific aspects of 
                    computing. It involves exploring fundamental questions about computation, conducting experiments, 
                    designing systems, and solving problems through programming (Denning et al., 1989). Computer Science 
                    combines both theory and practical application, enabling the development of algorithms, software, and 
                    computational models. It has a rich history as an academic field, with formal programs being offered since 1962 (Kim, 2016). 
                    The discipline continues to evolve, addressing both foundational concepts and modern technological challenges, 
                    making it essential for understanding and advancing computing.

                <h2>Computing Discipline</h2>
                <p>Computing disciplines refer to the various specialized fields within the broader area of computing, 
                    each focusing on different aspects of technology, systems, and applications. 
                    According to Courte and Bishop-Clark (2009), the five recognized computing disciplines are Computer Science (CS), 
                    Information Technology (IT), Information Systems (IS), Computer Engineering (CE), and Software Engineering (SE). 
                    These disciplines are widely accepted by universities and industry standards. In recent years, new fields such as 
                    cybersecurity and data science have also emerged (Tach & Heiner, 2022). Each discipline has a specific focus: CS 
                    emphasizes theoretical and scientific aspects of computing, IT deals with computing infrastructure and user needs, 
                    IS focuses on computing in organizational and business contexts, CE merges computer science and electrical engineering 
                    to design hardware and software, and SE prioritizes reliable software system development. Together, these disciplines 
                    illustrate the diverse and evolving nature of the computing field.</p>

                <p>Computer science (CS) focuses on computation and its applications,
                    evolving rapidly alongside technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum
                    computing, and cybersecurity. Baldwin (2011) describes CS as an academic
                    discipline for understanding both theoretical foundations and practical
                    applications of computing. CS is more than coding, but also value
                    development and understanding of computing. Denning et al. (1989)
                    emphasize that CS encompasses knowledge, practices, and values
                    necessary for creating dependable systems and collaborating effectively,
                    beyond just programming. As I understand, this definition highlights that CS is
                    not only about programming but also about value development and an
                    understanding of computing, as seen in Baldwin’s definition. However, in
                    Denning et al.'s definition, CS encompasses knowledge, practice, and values.
                    Moving on, CS has a rich history, with every development tracing back to the
                    discipline's beginnings, as Barr and Stephenson (2011) say.  Hazzan et al. (2015)
                    mentioned that the discipline includes its history and characterizations by
                    pioneers. Apirak et al. (2017) stated that the evolution of computer science is
                    characterized by continuous change and adaptation, driven by new
                    technological developments and societal needs. </p>

                <p>According to Courte and Bishop-Clark (2009), there have been five recognized computing
                    disciplines, which are computer science (CS), information technology (IT), information systems (IS),
                    computer engineering (CE), and software engineering (SE), that have been accepted by the
                    Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); these five encompass various disciplines recognized by
                    universities and industry standards. However, Tach and Heiner (2022) note that there are new
                    majors in the computing discipline, which are cybersecurity and data science. Computer science, as
                    stated by Denning et al. (1989), emphasizes theoretical and scientific aspects, including fundamental
                    questions, theory, experimentation, and design, along with programming and problem-solving. This
                    discipline has a rich history, having been offered since 1962 (Kim, 2016). In IT, Courte and Bishop
                    mention that IT focuses on computing infrastructure and user needs. Abernethy and Treu (2015)
                    describe IT as a program that incorporates interdisciplinary courses. Its inherent interdisciplinarity
                    and applied nature make it ideal for innovative programs of study aimed at attracting and
                    retaining students. IS, on the other hand, Courte and Bishop-Clark mention that it typically focuses
                    on computing within an organizational context, particularly in business settings. According to
                    "LibGuides: What" (2015), computer engineering merges computer science and electrical engineering,
                    focusing on the design and application of computer hardware and software. According to
                    Sommerville (2011), software engineering prioritizes dependable software systems, the
                    development lifecycle, and reliability. It focuses on learning from mistakes and ambiguities to
                    improve software reliability during development. I appreciate how Courte & Bishop-Clark well
                    defined the 5 computing disciplines, which are recognized by universities and industry standards,
                    and the definition of IS on how it focuses on the organizational and business context. With Tach &
                    Heiner's paper, I learned that cybersecurity and data science are two majors. I also understand
                    each computing discipline with the explanation of  different authors, with their well-defined
                    definitions.</p>
